## 🔌 API Integration & Data Storage

1. **Required API Keys**
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   LEMONFOX_API_KEY=your_lemonfox_api_key
   ```
   Add these to your `.env.local` file.

2. **Storage Architecture**
   - Zero server-side storage
   - All data stored in client's localStorage
   - Direct API processing with OpenAI and LemonFox
   - Audio files and results stored locally

3. **Benefits of Current Approach**
   - Reduced hosting costs
   - Enhanced privacy
   - Simplified architecture
   - Direct processing pipeline

4. **Alternative Storage Options**
   - AWS S3 for scalable file storage
   - Cloudflare R2 for edge storage
   - Consider these for production deployment

## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

### Audio Processing Issues
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent audio format compatibility
- **Problem**: ~50% of localStorage audio files fail during API processing
- **Current Status**: Under investigation
- **Workaround**: Implementing format validation before processing

### Real-time Processing
- **Challenge**: Immediate feedback generation
- **Solution**: Async processing, streaming analysis
- **Coming Soon**: Real-time transcription during speaking

### Scoring Consistency
- **Challenge**: Maintaining standardized scoring
- **Solution**: Calibrated assessment models

### PDF Generation
- **Challenge**: Consistent formatting
- **Solution**: Custom templating system
